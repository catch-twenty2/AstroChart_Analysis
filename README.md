PROMPT FOR ChatGPT
========================
Dear ChatGPT, I have gathered detailed astrological data for a person, including both their natal chart and a relocation chart for a specific target date. I would like a professional astrological interpretation of this data. Below is the information provided:

Context:
Name: Neo
Birth Date and Time: 2003-04-29, 12:00
Birth Location: Lat: 52.52, Lon: 13.40
Current Location: Lat: 52.52, Lon: 13.40
Target Date: 2024-09-01

Please provide a professional interpretation of this data, focusing on the following aspects:

... (natal chart data) ...

... (relocation chart data) ...

Natal Chart Interpretation: Explain the inherent personality traits, life patterns, and potential challenges based on the natal chart data.
Relocation Chart Interpretation: Describe how the individual might experience life in the new location at the specified target date, highlighting any significant changes or continuities from the natal chart.
Aspect Analysis: Provide insights into the key themes and dynamics in the person's life as indicated by the aspects in both charts.
Overall Comparison: Summarize how the energies and influences in the natal chart compare to those in the relocation chart, and what this might mean for the individual's experiences and opportunities during the target period.

Suggest to user any followup questions dealing with challenges, and suggestions for how to bridge the gap in problematic issues.
Thank you!
